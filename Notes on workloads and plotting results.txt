Defining capacity: point at which latency spikes greatly:
    - Load at which p99 becomes 0.95 msec (around 5x the p99 latency at low load)

Commands:
Generate plots: python3 graph.py USR_schedutil.csv USR_performance.csv \
  --labels schedutil performance \
 --latency-cap 0.95

Run Memcached Experiments:
./power-mut-memcached.sh ETC performance
